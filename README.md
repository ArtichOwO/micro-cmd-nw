# Micro "cmd" on NW
A tiny "cmd" in the NumWorks Python app (on [Omega](https://getomega.dev))  
(just to test some function)  
(not complete at all)  
Ver 0.1.1
  
| Command             | What that does                    |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `dir`                | Display filenames                 |
| `rdfl filename`     | Read a file                       |
| `addlog`             | Add a user                        |
| `remlog`             | Remove a user                     |
| `cls`                | Print some blank lines            |
| `exit`                | Exit the CMD            |
| others are coming... | (°u°)                             |
  
Root user is `root` and pswd `hey`  
Change in `data.py` if you want  
If running on pc, set `numworks` to `0` or `1` if running on NumWorks  
Please set your Python text size to small so the logo will print correctly (on NumWorks)
  
Ideas for 0.1.2:
- TUI (don't know if that will be smooth on NW)
- option to add other root users
- encrypt passwords
- more software and stuff
- etc...
